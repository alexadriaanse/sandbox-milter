OVERVIEW

The purpose of this milter is to trap and redirect certain emails.  This is
useful for a development environment, where certain emails that are sent out by
accident, e.g. to real customers, are redirected to a developer's email address.

sandbox_milter provides both an "smtpd" and "nonsmtpd" milter.  The type of
milter that is started is determined through a command-line argument.


PREREQUISITES
- Python 2.5 (provided by the Debian python2.5 package)
- Python milter (provided by the Debian python-milter package)

This milter has been tested with Postfix 2.5 on Debian Linux 5.0.


EXAMPLE POSTFIX CONFIGURATION

milter_default_action = accept
non_smtpd_milters = unix:/milter/sandbox_nonsmtpd_milter.sock
smtpd_milters = unix:/milter/sandbox_smtpd_milter.sock
milter_protocol = 6

(Note: Postfix is chrooted on Debian by default chrooted, so be sure to keep
that in mind when configuring the milter socket paths)


USAGE

sandbox_milter.py smtpd
    -or-
sandbox_milter.py nonsmtpd

Output is logged to the mail.info and/or mail.debug syslog facilities


CONFIGURATION

The valid_senders file contains a list of legitimate senders whose emails are
NOT redirected IFF sent through SMTP.

The allowed_recipients contains a list of recipients whose emails are never
redirected to <redirect_address>.  This usually contains a list of development
and test user email addresses.  This file can contain both emails and domains
(in the form of "@domain.tld").

Neither valid_senders nor allowed_recipients files should contain any comments
or anything other than email addresses or domains.

The valid_senders and allowed_recipients files are re-read upon each email
delivery, so changes to these two files do not require sandbox_milter to be
restarted.  The text format that is used in both files causes the milter to not
scale well when these two files grow large.  Should this be the case, these
files should be turned into database or hash files.

Changes to sandbox_milter.cfg will require sandbox_milter to be restarted in
order for these changes to take effect.


RULES IMPLEMENTED BY SANDBOX_MILTER

Redirect email to <redirect_address> unless:
  1. Envelope sender email address is in valid_senders list AND email is sent through SMTP, or
  2. Envelope recipient email address or domain is in allowed_recipients
